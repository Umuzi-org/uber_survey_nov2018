Analysis of surveys done in person with Uber partner drivers at the 
Johannesburg GLH during 5 - 9 November 2018, the Uber Expo at the 
TicketPro Dome, Wednesday 5 December 2018, as well as an online survey sent to drivers.

The survey asks about interest in studying, what drivers would like to

study part-time.
